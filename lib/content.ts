## High-Resolution Website Screenshots with Screenia - A Free and Open-Source Service
Screenia, a free and open-source service, allows you to easily capture entire website screenshots. Simply input the website link to create a snapshot in a matter of seconds.

Screenia lets you make screenshots of a variety of online pages, including websites, landing pages, articles, social network postings (Facebook, Instagram, VKontakte, and more), news articles, tweets with comments, forum threads, and videos on platforms such as YouTube.

## A User-Friendly Interface for Everyone
Our UI is developed with simplicity and intuitiveness in mind, making it easy to use even for first-time users. There's no need to install any additional software on your PC, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Full-page screenshots are accessible without watermarks, logos, or hyperlinks and may be seen online without registering or using an email address.

## Advanced Feature for Tech-Aware Users
Advanced users may create screenshots with even more precision and quality using Screenia's API. The AJAX scripts' content and the actual fonts used on the website are both captured by the API.

## How to Capture a Screenshot of a Website
With Screenia, taking a screenshot is simple. Enter the website's whole URL in the "Enter URL" section, then click "Generate." Since our script may only access resources that are available to everyone without requiring captchas, usernames, or passwords, the URL must be widely accessible.

After generating the screenshot, you can preview the image and download it in your preferred format, including .jpg or .png.

## Screenia allows you to take an unlimited number of screenshots.
Screenia is free forever and open-source, allowing you to create unlimited screenshots at no cost.
